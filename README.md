Dragging-and-dropping files and folders is supported but requires SilverBullet v0.7.2 or greater. If running < v0.7.2, this feature will be automatically disabled (regardless of [configuration](#configuration)).

## Installation

Use the `Plugs: Add` command and enter the following URI:

`github:joekrill/silverbullet-treeview/treeview.plug.js`

_or_

Open (`cmd+k`) your `PLUGS` note in SilverBullet and add this plug to the list:

```yaml
- github:joekrill/silverbullet-treeview/treeview.plug.js
```

Then run the `Plugs: Update` command and off you go!

## Configuration

This plug can be configured using the `SETTINGS` page (default values shown):

```yaml
treeview:
  # Determines where the panel is displayed:
  # - "lhs" - left hand side
  # - "rhs" - right hand side
  # - "bhs" - bottom
  # - "modal" - in a modal
  position: lhs
  positionOnMobile: modal

  # Must be > 0.
  # position = "lhs" | "rhs": determines the width of the panel.
  # position = "modal": sets the margin around the modal window.
  # position = "bhs": No effect
  size: 1

  dragAndDrop:
    # Set to false to disable drag-and-drop
    enabled: true

    # Set to false to disable the confirmation prompt shown when dragging and
    # dropping pages that causes them to be renamed/moved.
    confirmOnRename: true
```

### Adding a top bar toggle icon

![Screenshot](screenshot-action-button.png)

You can add add a button to the top bar that will toggle the tree view by adding
the following to your `actionButtons` array in your `SETTINGS` page:

```yaml
actionButtons:
- icon: sidebar
  command: "{[Tree View: Toggle]}"
  description: "Toggle Tree View"
```

## Build

To build this plug, make sure you have [SilverBullet installed](https://silverbullet.md/Install). Then, build the plug with:

```shell
deno task build
```

Or to watch for changes and rebuild automatically

```shell
deno task watch
```

Then, copy the resulting `.plug.js` file into your space's `_plug` folder. Or build and copy in one command:

```shell
deno task build && cp *.plug.js /my/space/_plug/
```

SilverBullet will automatically sync and load the new version of the plug (or speed up this process by running the {[Sync: Now]} command).

## Development
